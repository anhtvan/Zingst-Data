# Zingst-Data

The file `Na21Zingst_copy` is the original raw dataset that I received, and the file `Zingst_data_edited` represents a cleaner version of the data to be used for downstream analysis. 

The PNG files are basic visualization files of several variables, completed in R. 

`presummer` -  before August 1, 1991

`postsummer`- after August 3, 1991
